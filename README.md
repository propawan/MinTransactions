# Minimum Transactions
It is a cashflow minimization project.
It helps in minimizing the number of transactions between N number of people.
I have implemented the algorithm part in JS and front end part in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
I have used the vis.js library to display the transactions in a graph form.
